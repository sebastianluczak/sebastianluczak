I'm in desperate need of a universal tool to "to bring them all and in the darkness bind them" in terms of Time and Task trackers.

Currently I'm developing fun side project - a [PHP-cli Roguelike game](https://sebastianluczak.github.io/php-roguelike/) heavily based on ADOM, with few concepts taken out from D&D and Fallout mixed with Enter The Gungeon, Hades, Diablo. I know it's a silly idea to make single player roguelike in console, but I'm using it as a playground for testing my skills and new ideas. Feel free to comment and or put some PR's in open-sourced [repository](https://github.com/sebastianluczak/php-roguelike). There's even a [whole board](https://github.com/sebastianluczak/php-roguelike/projects/1) dedicated to this project alone!
