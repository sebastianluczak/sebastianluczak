## Hello Dear Traveler

My name is [Sebastian](https://brodaty.dev) and I'm [IT Magician🦄](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianmluczak/).

🚀 I used to be a Fullstack Developer but I've found myself more at the place where business meets technology.🚀

I've been called Web App Developer, PHP Specialist, Full Stack Engineer, Linux Administrator, Lead Manager, Tech Lead and so on, but at the end of the day, I'm just an 🌈 IT Magician 🌈. 
I've touched and worked with every possible area of IT Product and Project Management, ate my teeth as Architect and Business Advisor, crafted 50++ PHP applications currently running somewhere in the world 🌏. And I have not said my final word.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.JS and Python, while maintaining Junior PHP Academy
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on external projects with tight deadlines and/or complicated architecture and/or tech debt
- 💬 Ask me about my free slots in calendar and talk about PHP/Architecture/possible cooperation
- 📫 How to reach me directly? Just message me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianmluczak/)
- ⚡ Fun facts 'bout me: I can solve Rubic's cube in under 60 seconds, cite Battlestar Galactica's Adama speech word-to-word even after large amount of booze and I'm addicted to LEGO Star-Wars UCS series (those big ones, yeah)

## What I'm passionate about:

[![unittr_logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1628839/149616114-012681cf-4df3-4223-be03-e41ed0b95335.png)](https://github.com/sebastianluczak/unittr)

I'm in desperate need of a universal tool to "to bring them all and in the darkness bind them" in terms of Time and Task trackers.
So... [Shall I make one?](https://github.com/sebastianluczak/unittr)

PoC has been created and is currently under heavy testing. Clockify and JIRA Worklog integration are working seemlesly and closely to examples listed above. Development is concentrated around one private repository because at this moment it's implementation is strictly tied to accounts and processes within my organization.

As soon as I derive functionality and hide it under interfaces I'll share it publicly as an unittr open source project.

Currently I'm developing fun side project - a [PHP-cli Roguelike game](https://sebastianluczak.github.io/php-roguelike/) heavily based on ADOM, with few concepts taken out from D&D and Fallout mixed with Enter The Gungeon, Hades, Diablo. I know it's a silly idea to make single player roguelike in console, but I'm using it as a playground for testing my skills and new ideas. Feel free to comment and or put some PR's in open-sourced [repository](https://github.com/sebastianluczak/php-roguelike). There's even a [whole board](https://github.com/sebastianluczak/php-roguelike/projects/1) dedicated to this project alone!
